1_  This algorithm is used to find the convex hull of the points in the plane.
2_  The complexity of algorithm is O(n^2)... and is less efficient than grahamscan algo as it takes all points in
      the calculations.

Algorithm :
         can go by any orientation .
         say (counter-clockwise)
         1> start with p which is leftmost point.
         2> - choose q point such that orientation(p,q,r) is counterclockwise and r is remaining points in the space other than
              the points added in the hull.
            -  add q in the hull .
            - let p = q and continue till all the remaining points are covered.
