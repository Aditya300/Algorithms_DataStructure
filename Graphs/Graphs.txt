    4 ways to represent Graphs are :
 
    1.  Edge List - This is basically the array  of edeges {{1,2},{3,4},{2,3},{5,4}}
    
    2.  Adjacency Matrix - This is the V*V Matrix which is having 2 values 1 and 0
        if theres a edge in v1 and v2 then matrix[v1][v2] is 1 else 0
    
    3.  Adjacency List - This is combintion of Adjacency Matrix with edge list
        The vertices in the list Store all the adjacent vertices .each member of 
        list is basically the list that has all its adjacent vertices as its members.

    4.  Incidence Matrix - Here the V*V matrix is created and each element is the 
        value of edge . If theres no edge between vertices then the value is 
        infinity.
