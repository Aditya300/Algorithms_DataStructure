Heap is a special kind of balanced binary tree in which the root-node key is 
compared with its children and arranged accordingly

Binary Heap :

    1. Its a complete Tree
    2. Its either Max heap or Min Heap [The child element is compared to the 
        parent element and then property is satisfied.
   
Applications :
    1. Heap Sort : This algo used heaping techniques for its working in O(nlogn)
    2. Priority Queue : The PQ's can be successfully implemented using the Heaps
    3. The graph Min Spanning Tree,DJKasatras algorithm questions can be
       successfully implemented using Heaps. 
    4. Many rpoblems like get Kth largest element in array,sort nearly sorted
       array,Merge K sorted arrays,etc can be successfully implemented using heaps.

Operations ;
    
    1. getMini()/getMaxi() :
    2. extractMin()/extractMax() :
    3. decreaseKey() :
    4. insert() :
    5. delete() :
